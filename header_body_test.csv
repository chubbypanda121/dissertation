lloyds_d,Ways we use your data,,,,,,,,,
lloyds_d,These are some of the important ways we use your data,"If you're not sure what some of this information means, you may want to ask your parent or guardian to read this with you.",1,1,important,0,1,0,"Answer: No

Justification: The header mentions ""important ways we use your data"", implying that the following text will discuss how the bank uses customer data. However, the body text instead focuses on asking for parental guidance, which is unrelated to the use of customer data.",1
lloyds_d,We look after your personal information,"To open your account we need to know some things about you, like your name, address and date of birth. This is your personal information and Lloyds Bank will hold this information and look after it. How we use your personal information We need the information you give us to provide you with an account.",1,1,,1,0,1,"Yes.

The heading ""We look after your personal information"" matches the body text because it explicitly states that the bank will hold and look after the personal information provided by the customer. The heading sets up the expectation that the following text will discuss the handling of personal information, which is indeed what the body text does.",0
lloyds_d,We collect your personal information,"We collect information about you when you apply for accounts with us, like you are doing now. But we will also collect information at other times, for example if you call us on the phone or talk to someone in one of our branches.",0,0,collect,0,0,0.6666666666666666,"Yes.

The heading ""We collect your personal information"" matches the body text because it explicitly states that the bank collects information about customers, which aligns with the body's description of collecting information during account application and other interactions. The connection between the heading and body is implicit, as the heading doesn't specify what kind of information is being collected, but the body provides context.",0
lloyds_d,Who we share your personal information with,"Lloyds Bank is part of Lloyds Banking Group, so to run your account we have to share your personal information with different parts of our group. Sometimes we also need to share your personal information with other companies who help us provide important services, for example we need to share your data so you can buy something in a shop using your debit card.",0,0,share,0,0,1,"Yes.

The heading ""Who we share your personal information with"" matches the body text because it explicitly states that the purpose of the paragraph is to explain who receives the customer's personal information. The heading provides a clear indication of what the reader will learn from reading the paragraph.",0
lloyds_d,How we use your personal information,"We need the information you give us to provide you with an account. We use your personal information so you can do things, like pay for something you want to buy or check what money you have in your account online. If you want to know more about how we use your personal information please visit the privacy page on our website.",0,1,,1,0,1,"Answer: Yes

Justification: The header ""How we use your personal information"" asks about the purpose of collecting and using the customer's personal data. The body text explains that the bank uses the customer's personal information to provide them with an account and perform various transactions, such as paying bills or checking account balances. This aligns with the question asked in the header, providing an answer to how the bank uses the customer's personal information.",0
santander_l,Personal Loan,,,,,,,,,
santander_l,Pre-Contractual explanation,,,,,,,,,
santander_l,What is a 'Personal Loan?',"A personal loan from Santander is a loan for a fixed amount, repayable over a fixed period of time with interest charged at a fixed rate. The duration or term of the loan will depend on what is agreed at the time the loan is made but is generally for a short or medium term. The loan is unsecured which means that Santander will not take a charge over your property when you take out the loan.",0,1,,1,0,1,"Answer: Yes

Justification: The header ""What is a 'Personal Loan?'"" asks about the definition or explanation of a personal loan, which the body text provides by describing its key characteristics such as being for a fixed amount, having a fixed period of repayment, and being unsecured.",0
santander_l,Put Simply,"It's money that you borrow from us. The amount of the money that you borrow, the interest rate and the repayment time period are all fixed. We don't take security for a personal loan.",1,1,,1,1,0,"Answer: No

Justification: The header ""Put Simply"" suggests that the following text will be a concise and straightforward explanation of a complex concept. However, the body text appears to be providing detailed information about the terms and conditions of a personal loan, rather than simply explaining what a personal loan is. The language used is formal and informative, rather than simple and concise, which contradicts the expectation set by the header.",1
santander_l,What checks do you need to do for me to get a personal loan with Santander," If you wish to apply for a loan then we will, with your prior consent, conduct a search of your credit history with a credit reference agency. This will leave a record on your credit file. We may decline your application if you provide us with any false information as part of your application, or if there are issues with your credit score when we check your details with a credit reference agency. We will give you details of the agency that we used to inform our decision so you may contact them. For more information, a leaflet called ‘Your application and credit scoring’ is available on request.",0,0,check,0,0,0.16666666666666666,"No

The heading asks about ""checks"" needed to get a personal loan, but the body text talks about searching credit history, checking credit score, and providing false information, which are different types of checks. The heading does not accurately reflect the content of the body text.",1
santander_l,Put Simply,"To apply for a personal loan you must agree to us conducting a credit check on you. It's very important to provide accurate information in your application - we might decline your application based on the results of your credit check, or if you have provided false information.",1,1,,1,1,0,"Answer: No

Justification: The header ""Put Simply"" suggests that the following text will be a concise explanation of a complex concept. However, the body text discusses the requirement for a credit check as part of the personal loan application process, which doesn't seem to fit the tone or purpose implied by the header.",1
santander_l,How much do I have to pay under the agreement,"You will need to make repayments every month which include principal (the original loan amount) and interest over the duration of the loan. The monthly repayments will be for the same amount every month until the loan is fully repaid. Details of the amount you have to pay (both monthly and in total, including all interest) including the frequency and number of repayments, and the duration of the loan, are contained in your credit agreement.",0,0,"pay, agreement",0,0,0.6666666666666666,"Answer: Yes

Justification: The header asks ""How much do I have to pay under the agreement"", which is answered by the body text that explains the components of monthly repayments (principal and interest), the frequency and duration of repayments, and how to find the detailed information in the credit agreement.",0
santander_l,Put Simply,"You pay a fixed amount each month (made up of the original loan amount and the interest charged). Your credit agreement will detail how much you pay (in total and each month), and when the payments will be due.",1,1,,1,1,0,"Answer: No

Justification: The header ""Put Simply"" suggests that the following text should be a concise and easy-to-understand explanation of a complex concept. However, the body text appears to be providing detailed information about repayment terms, including the composition of monthly payments and payment schedules, which does not fit the expectation set by the header.",1
santander_l,What are the consequences if I do not keep up with repayments?,"If you fail to make a repayment on the date it falls due you may be charged interest on any arrears that you incur at the same interest rate as you pay on your loan. As a consequence the total cost of the loan may increase. If you have any current or savings account with Santander UK or any other member of the Santander Group, we may move funds from those accounts to settle any outstanding payments on your loan. If you miss a loan payment we will record the details with a credit reference agency which could damage your credit rating and may make it more difficult for you to obtain credit in the future. Also, failure to make your loan payments when they fall due may result in legal proceedings being taken against you by Santander UK plc, which may result in us taking enforcement action against you in order to recover the monies that are owed. If you don’t make your repayments and incur significant arrears we may decide to sell or transfer your loan to a debt recovery company. That company may commence legal proceedings against you that may result in enforcement action being taken against your property for recovery of the monies owed.",0,0,repayment,0,0,0.3333333333333333,"Answer: Yes

Justification: The header asks about the consequences of not keeping up with repayments, and the body text provides detailed explanations of what happens if a customer fails to make a repayment, including potential charges, increased costs, damage to credit ratings, legal proceedings, and debt recovery actions. The body text directly addresses the question posed by the header, providing relevant and related information about the consequences of non-payment.",0
santander_l,Put Simply,"If you miss a repayment, you’ll be charged interest on the missed payment, so you end up paying back more on your loan. In addition, we can deduct the missed payment and interest from your other accounts with us. If you miss multiple repayments, your credit rating can be damaged and you might have personal legal proceedings brought against you. To avoid getting into this situation, please contact us if you are having difficulties in making your repayments.",1,1,,1,1,0,"Answer: No

Justification: The header ""Put Simply"" suggests that the following text will be a concise explanation of a complex concept. However, the body text does not provide a simple explanation; instead, it lists potential consequences of missing a repayment, including additional charges, deductions from other accounts, damage to credit rating, and personal legal proceedings. The tone is serious and warning-oriented, rather than simple and explanatory.",1
santander_l,Are there any features of the agreement which may operate in a manner which may adversely affect me?,"Before applying for a Personal Loan you should read all the pre-contractual information and the credit agreement provided to you carefully to ensure that this is the best product for you and that you understand the features of this product. If you breach the terms of the agreement you may be charged default interest which is detailed in your credit agreement. Also, if you don’t make your repayments and incur significant arrears we may decide to sell or transfer your loan to a debt recovery company.",0,0,agreement,0,0,0.42857142857142855,"Answer: Yes

Justification: The header asks about potential adverse effects of the agreement, and the body text discusses consequences of breaching the agreement, such as being charged default interest and having the loan sold or transferred to a debt recovery company. These consequences could be considered ""features"" of the agreement that may operate in a manner that affects the customer negatively.",0
santander_l,Put Simply,We’ve prepared a document for you called ‘Pre-contract Credit Information’ which you should read and consider carefully before taking out a Personal Loan to make sure that it is right for you.,1,1,,1,1,0,"Answer: No

Justification: The header ""Put Simply"" suggests that the following text will be concise and easy to understand, but the body text does not meet this expectation. Instead, it presents a formal instruction to read a specific document, which is not a simple explanation. The tone and content of the body text do not match the promise made by the header.",1
santander_l,Your Right to Cancel (and repay early),"You have 14 days to change your mind from the date that you sign the agreement – this can be either changing the amount of the loan, seeking a different facility, or cancelling the loan altogether. If you exercise the right to withdraw from the agreement you must repay any monies we have advanced to you within 30 days from the date that you notified us of your intention to cancel. If you want to cancel you can do so by contacting us in writing or by telephone. Please refer to the agreement for details and the addresses of who to contact. You are entitled to repay the loan in full any time after the initial period of 14 days. Details of how you may do this and who to contact if you wish to exercise this right – together with details of any charges that may apply – are contained in the agreement.",0,0,"cancel, repay",0,0,0.75,"Answer: Yes

Justification: The header ""Your Right to Cancel (and repay early)"" suggests that the following text will discuss the customer's options for terminating or modifying the agreement. The body text indeed explains the process of exercising the right to cancel, including the timeframe, repayment requirements, and contact information. While the text also mentions repaying the loan early, it does so as part of the broader discussion of cancellation rights, making the connection between the header and body logical and coherent.",0
santander_l,Put Simply,"You can change your mind up to 14 days after you sign. If you do this, you must repay anything you owe. You may repay the loan in full at any time before the final payment is due. Details of how to do this are in your agreement. A personal loan is designed for borrowing a fixed amount of money over the full term of the loan, however it can be repaid early, if you wish. If you’re thinking about doing this you should carefully check your credit contract beforehand, as costs and charges may apply when it is repaid before the end of the full term.",1,1,,1,1,0,"Answer: No

Justification: The header ""Put Simply"" suggests that the following text will be a concise explanation of a complex concept. However, the body text discusses various aspects of changing one's mind, repaying a loan, and repaying a personal loan early, which doesn't seem to fit the promise of simplicity implied by the header.",1
first_direct_l,Personal Loan,,,,,,,,,
first_direct_l,Terms and Conditions,,,,,,,,,
first_direct_l,Personal Loan Terms and Conditions,,,,,,,,,
first_direct_l,How and when will we give you the loan?,"When you have signed and returned the agreement, we will sign it. The agreement will start on that day and will end when you have repaid everything you owe us. 1. We will pay the loan into the current account you gave in your application. This will usually be no more than 5 working days after the start date or the specific date you asked for. If the loan is to repay any other borrowing from us, the amount in your current account will be what is left over (if anything) after we have taken away the amount needed to repay those borrowings. 2. If you repay more than the total amount payable, we will close the account and return the amount you overpaid to another account you hold with us or by sending you a cheque.",1,1,give,0,0,0.5,"No.

The heading ""How and when will we give you the loan?"" suggests that the body text should describe the process of receiving the loan, but instead, it describes the terms and conditions of the loan agreement, including repayment and payment details. There is no direct connection between the heading and the body text.",1
first_direct_l,What is the cost of the loan?,"3. We charge a fixed amount of interest which we add to the loan when we open the loan account. The total amount payable by you is the sum of interest and the loan. Although it is added upfront, we work out interest (and the APR) as if the loan amount was reduced by each projected repayment, using the interest rate, the number of monthly repayments and the period of the loan. In other words, your monthly repayments will pay off the sum of interest and the loan amount in different proportions each month. Towards the start of your loan, your monthly payments will pay off more interest, and towards the end of the loan they will pay off more of the loan amount. For these purposes, we assume we provide the loan one month before the first repayment date. ",0,0,cost,0,0,0.5,"Answer: Yes

Justification: The header ""What is the cost of the loan?"" asks about the expense associated with taking out a loan, which the body text addresses by explaining how interest is calculated and added to the loan. The text also mentions the total amount payable, which includes both interest and the loan amount, providing an answer to the question about the cost of the loan.",0
first_direct_l,How must you repay the loan?,"4. You must make the monthly repayments set out in your agreement. If a repayment date is a non-working day you must make the repayment (or we will collect it) on the next working day. 5. After you have mde your first repayment, you can change the monthly repayment date if you ask us. We will not be able ot change your next repayment date but we will change all subsequent repayment dates. You can only change the date twice in any 12 month period. Changing the repayment date will not affect the amount of interest on the loan.",0,0,repay,0,0,0.6666666666666666,"No

The heading ""How must you repay the loan?"" does not explicitly match the content of the body text, which discusses specific details about making monthly repayments, changing repayment dates, and handling non-working days. The heading seems to focus on the general question of how to repay the loan, while the body text provides more specific information about the process.",1
first_direct_l,What should you do if your details change?,"6. If you change your name, address, telephone number or email address you must tell us in writing or by calling us. We will use the most recent details you have given us to send information and contact you.",0,0,"detail, change",0,0,1,"Yes.

The heading ""What should you do if your details change?"" matches the body text because it explicitly states what action needs to be taken when one's details change (i.e., informing the bank). The body text provides specific examples of the types of changes that require notification, which aligns with the heading's focus on what to do when details change.",0
first_direct_l,Can you repay the loan early?,"7. You can repay all, or part, of the loan early by giving us notice in writing or by telephone. If you give us notice, we will tell you the amount needed to repay the loan in full within the next 28 days (or on a later date you tell us). 8. If you repay part of the loan early, your monthly repayment will stay the same but you may repay the loan more quickly. If you repay the loan in full, the formula in the regulations we use to work out the reduced amount of interest we can charge, works as if we charged interest at the rate that applies to the loan from the date we gave you the loan to the date which is 28 days after you give us notice, plus an additional month if your loan is repayable over a period of more than 12 months. For example, if the loan is for 36 months and you give us notice on 1 September that you want to repay the loan on 14 September, the amount required to repay the loan will include interest up to 29 October.",0,0,"repay, early",0,0,1,"Answer: Yes

Justification: The header ""Can you repay the loan early?"" is answered by the body text, which explains how to repay the loan early, including providing notice, calculating the amount needed to repay the loan, and the impact on monthly repayments.",0
first_direct_l,What are our rights if you miss a repayment or we have other concerns?,"9. There may be severe consequences if: (a) you do not make repayments on time; or (b) we find that any information you provided as part of your loan application was materially incorrect or misleading; or (c) you are declared bankrupt or have similar proceedings taken against you; or (d) we reasonably suspect any fraud or other criminal activity in connection with this agreement and/or any other facility or account that you have with us. In any of these cases, we can: demand immediate repayment of the loan; restrict access to credit on other accounts you have with us (such as an overdraft or credit card); bring legal action to recover the loan (which could include asking a court to order that, if a property you own is sold for any reason, some of the sale proceeds are used to repay this loan); and require you to pay our reasonable costs and expenses for taking action to obtain payment, including legal costs; but we will give you advance notice and (unless the problem cannot be fixed) the opportunity to fix the problem before taking any of these steps. 10. If we choose not to enforce our rights under this agreement at any time, we may enforce them at a later date instead.",0,0,repayment,0,0,0.5,"Answer: Yes

Justification: The header asks about the bank's rights in specific situations, and the body text describes those situations and the consequences that may follow. The body text explains what actions the bank can take if certain conditions are met, which aligns with the question asked in the header.",0
first_direct_l,Can we use any other funds to repay the loan?,"11. If we hold any money for you on another account (for example if you have money in a current or savings account), we can use it to reduce or repay any sums you fail to pay under this agreement but only after we have checked that you have enough left in your accounts to cover essential living costs. We will give you advance notice and the opportunity to fix the problem first. 12. If you have provided security for any other borrowing from us, it will not apply to the loan.",0,0,repay,0,0,0.75,"No

The heading ""Can we use any other funds to repay the loan?"" does not explicitly match the content of the body text, which discusses using funds from other accounts to reduce or repay the loan, as well as providing security for other borrowings. The heading seems to focus on the idea of repaying the loan using alternative funds, whereas the body text covers additional scenarios beyond just repayment.",1
first_direct_l,Can we transfer our rights under this agreement?,"13. We may transfer our rights and our obligations under this agreement to a third party, including information about you and how you have managed the loan which the third party needs to know.",0,0,"transfer, agreement",0,0,1,"Answer: Yes

Justification: The header asks ""Can we transfer our rights under this agreement?"", which is answered by the body text that explains the possibility of transferring rights and obligations to a third party.",0
first_direct_l,What law governs this agreement?,"14. This agreement, and everything that happens in relation to this agreement before it is made, are governed by the laws, and subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts, of England and Wales. We will communicate with you at all times in English.",0,0,agreement,0,0,0.6666666666666666,"Answer: Yes

Justification: The header asks ""What law governs this agreement?"", which is answered by the body text stating that the agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales.",0
first_direct_l,Right to withdraw,"You can withdraw from this agreement (without giving any reason) by sending written notice or calling us within 14 days, starting the day after we confirm that we have signed the agreement. To tell us that you want to withdraw, please use the details under Important Information below.",0,0,withdraw,0,0,0.5,"Answer: Yes

Justification: The header ""Right to withdraw"" suggests that the body text should explain the process of withdrawing from an agreement. The body text indeed explains how to withdraw from the agreement, providing specific instructions and a timeframe (14 days).",0
first_direct_l,Important Information,,,,,,,,,
first_direct_l,How can you keep track of what you owe,"You may ask us at any time for a statement of account. This statement will be in the form of a table setting out: details (including the amounts) of the repayments you still owe, the dates on which each repayment is due, and a breakdown of each repayment showing how much comprises capital, interest and, if applicable, other charges. We will not charge for the statement.",0,0,"track, owe",0,0,0.3333333333333333,"Answer: Yes

Justification: The header ""How can you keep track of what you owe"" suggests that the customer wants to know how they can monitor their outstanding debt. The body text provides an answer to this question by explaining that customers can request a statement of account, which includes detailed information about their outstanding repayments, making it easier for them to keep track of what they owe.",0
first_direct_l,How can you make a complaint,"If we do not give the standard of service you expect, or if you think we have made a mistake, please let us know so we can investigate, put matters right and take steps to prevent it happening again.

• To allow us to meet our legal obligations (for example, getting proof of your identity to meet our anti-money laundering obligations)
• To protect our legitimate interests (for example, to understand how customers use our services so we can develop new services and improve the services we currently provide)
• We have your permission to use your information
• In the case of sensitive personal data (also known as special categories of personal data), it is in the substantial public interest (for example, to support you if you are or become a vulnerable customer).
The table below sets out what we use your personal data for and our legal basis for doing so. Where our legal basis is a legitimate interest (that is, where our interests do not outweigh our customers’ interests), those interests are also set out in the table.",,,"legal, basis",0,,,,
barclays_c,Sensitive personal data,"Some of the information we collect is sensitive personal data (also known as special categories of data). In particular, we may process personal data that relates to your health (such as your medical history), biometric data, and any criminal convictions and offences. If we use sensitive personal data, we will usually do so on the legal basis that it is in the wider public interest, to establish, take or defend any legal action or, in some cases, that we have your permission. In any case, we will keep to all laws that apply. We will send you messages by post, telephone, text message, email and other digital methods, including through our cash machines, apps, push notifications (messages that pop up on mobile devices) or online banking services, and through new methods that may become available in the future. These messages may be:
• to help you manage your account
• messages we must send to meet our regulatory obligations, such as about changes to your agreements, and to give you information on managing your money
• to keep you informed about the features and benefits of the products and services we provide to you; or
• to tell you about products and services (including those of other companies) that may be of interest to you. These are marketing messages. You can ask us to stop or start sending you marketing messages at any time by writing to us, visiting a branch, calling us or, if you use online banking or the Barclays app, when you are logged in.
We may ask you for permission to collect and use certain types of personal data when we have to do so by law (for example, when we process sensitive personal data or place cookies or similar technologies on devices or browsers). If we ask you for permission to process your personal data, you can refuse, or withdraw your permission at any time, by using the details at the end of this privacy notice or, if in relation to cookies or similar, through the cookie policy on barclays.co.uk.",,,sensitive,0,,,,
barclays_c,Who we will share your information with,"We will keep your information confidential but we may share it with third parties (who also have to keep it secure and confidential) in the following circumstances. Barclays Group companies. We are owned by Barclays PLC, so we work closely with other businesses and companies in the Barclays Group of companies. We may share certain information with other Barclays Group companies (for example, to provide you with products or services, for marketing purposes, for internal reporting and where those companies provide services to us).
Third party payers. We may share your name with anyone paying money into your account if this is necessary to confirm the payment is being made to the right account. (We would only do this if the payer’s name is a close match with your name or a joint account holder’s name.) This does not apply to children under 13.
Other financial institutions who you ask us to deal with (for example, when you switch your account from Barclays).
Companies (such as utility companies) that you have paid from your Barclays account and that ask us for our help so they can apply the payment to your account with them (for example, because they didn’t receive the information they needed when you made your payment).
We may share your personal data with our business partners who we provide services with (for example, a hotel or airline partner, card scheme, or those whose name or logo appears on a credit card or debit card we provide to you). We may also share information with other service providers and agents who provide services on our business partners’ behalf.
Insurance providers, including underwriters, brokers, introducers, claims handlers and other such associated third parties. When you make an insurance claim, information you give us or the insurer may be put on a register of claims. This will be shared with other insurers.
For mortgage customers, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), to confirm the income information you provide. HMRC may also use the information that we give them for their own checks and purposes and to check for any mismatch with your declared income.
Anyone we transfer or delegate (or may transfer or delegate) our rights or obligations to, as allowed under the terms and conditions of any contract you have with us.
Any potential guarantor.
Social media companies (in a secure format) so they can display messages to you and others about our products and services, or make sure you do not get irrelevant messages (for example, if you already have the Barclays product we want to advertise).
Providers of payment-processing services and other businesses that help us process your payments, as well as other financial institutions that are members of the payment schemes (for example, Visa) or involved in making payments, where that is needed for specific types of payment (for example, through Paym).
Other banks. If a payment goes into your account by mistake, we may provide details about you and the incorrect payment to the bank that sent the payment, so they can recover the funds.
Independent third-party service providers who you (or a third party properly authorised to give instructions on your behalf) ask us to share information with (for example, providers of payment-initiation or account-information services). If we share your information with these third parties, we will have no control over how they use it. You (or the person with authority over your account) will need to agree this direct with the third party.
Our service providers and agents (including their subcontractors). This may include, for example, third-party collection agents we use, or where we pass your details to someone who will print your statements, deliver a gift or provide a gesture of goodwill. We may also ask third-party providers who act on your behalf to share your information with our agents or sub-contractors to enable us to provide a service you have requested.
Insurance product and subscription service providers. If you take out an insurance product or subscription service so you can use the provider’s products and services, and to allow them to identify you as a customer, we share your personal data with the provider. The information you give direct to the provider will also be shared with us.
Government agencies (for example, the Skills Funding Agency or its agents, third-party suppliers, subcontractors, advisers and group companies, for the purposes of managing the Professional and Career Development Loan).
Any third party after a restructure, sale or acquisition of any Barclays company or debt, as long as that person uses your information for the same purposes you originally gave it us for.
Your advisers (such as accountants, lawyers and other professional advisers) who you have authorised to represent you, or any other person you have told us is authorised to give instructions, or use the account, products or services, on your behalf (such as under a power of attorney).

UK and overseas regulators, law enforcement agencies and authorities in connection with their duties, such as preventing crime (whether directly or through third parties such as credit reference agencies), or carrying out social or economic statistical research. This may include payment details (including information about others involved in the payment).
Fraud prevention agencies and other third parties, in connection with actual or suspected fraud, financial crime
or criminal activities, or with monitoring, preventing and investigating fraud, financial crime or criminal activities. In particular, we will always tell fraud prevention agencies if you give us false or fraudulent information. They will also allow other organisations (in the UK or abroad), including law enforcement agencies, to use this information to prevent and detect fraud or other crimes. You can ask us for the details of the fraud prevention agencies we share information with.
Credit reference agencies. For more information on this, please see below.

barclays_c,Sharing information about you with tax authorities outside the UK,"We may be required by law or regulation to share information about your accounts with relevant tax authorities, either directly or through the local tax authority. The tax authority we share the information with could then share that information with other appropriate tax authorities. If we need extra documents or information from you about this, you must provide them. If you don’t, we may need to close your account or, if the law or other regulations require us to do so, we’ll withhold parts of certain payments received into your account, and pass the withheld funds to the relevant tax authorities. For more information, please see section 8 ‘Sharing information abroad’.",,,"tax, authority",0,,,,
barclays_c,Credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies,"We carry out credit and identity checks on you with one or more credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies. To do this, we will supply your personal data to the agencies and they will give us information about you.
We will also continue to exchange information about you (and your accounts) with credit reference agencies while you are our customer. The credit reference agencies may in turn share your personal data with other organisations, which those organisations may use to make decisions about you. This may affect your ability to get credit.
We may continue to collect information about you (and your accounts) from credit reference agencies after your account is closed.
Examples of circumstances when your information, or information about your partner or other members of your household, may be shared include the following:
• Checking details on applications for products and services
• Making credit and affordability assessments to decide whether to accept your application and setting credit limits
• Managing credit and credit-related accounts or facilities
• Tracing your address so that we can continue to contact you about any existing or previous products and accounts you held with us, as well as recovering debts that you owe
• Checking details on proposals (applications) and claims for all types of insurance
• Regularly checking your identity to keep to regulations and the law
• Providing identity-check services if you have asked the government, or another third party, to confirm your identity
• Making enquiries when you ask for any lending products or investment products, and to help us manage your account
• Understanding your financial position by sharing and receiving information (for example, about any borrowing, including borrowing outside Barclays, and how you manage it). This includes the amount you borrow and your payment history, including any payment arrangements

• To create ‘modelling tools’, (for example, methods of assessing how likely it is that a customer will invest in or open a new product, or methods to help us improve our products and services for customers)
• Updating personal data that is not included in our records, or is incorrect in our records, so we meet our legal or regulatory obligations.
We don’t give information about savings accounts to credit reference agencies.
The Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (CRAIN) describes how the three main credit reference agencies in the UK use and share personal data. The CRAIN is available on the credit reference agencies’ websites:
• www.transunion.co.uk/crain
• www.equifax.co.uk/crain
• www.experian.co.uk/crain
You can go to barclays.co.uk/control-your-data for details of the credit reference agencies we share information with.
Your information held by credit reference agencies may be linked to people who are associated with you, such as your partner or other members of your household. These linked records are called associated records. Any enquiry we make to a credit reference agency may be answered from both your own record and any associated records. Another person’s record will be associated with yours when:
• you are making a joint application
• you hold a joint credit account
• you tell us about a financial association with another person (for example, that they are your business partner); or
• the credit reference agencies already have existing associated records.
An associated record will be taken into account for all future applications made by either or both of you. The association continues until one of you makes a successful application for the credit reference agencies to file a ‘disassociation’, which allows your information to no longer be linked. You can check for any associations by getting your credit record direct from the credit reference agencies.
We and fraud prevention agencies may also share your personal data with law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate and prevent crime. If fraud is detected, you could be refused certain services or finance.
Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal data for different periods of time. If you are considered to pose a risk of fraud or money laundering, your personal data can be held for up to six years.",,,"credit, reference, agency, fraud, prevention, agency",0,,,,
barclays_c,Sharing information abroad,"When we or fraud prevention agencies share information with organisations in other countries, we will make sure they agree to apply equivalent levels of protection for personal data as we do. If this is not possible (for example, if the law states that we must pass on information) we will make sure the information is shared in line with the relevant law. Also, if a data protection authority does not consider their particular country to have adequate levels of protection for personal data, we will put in place appropriate measures (such as contractual commitments), in line with any legal requirements that apply, to make sure your personal data is adequately protected.
We or fraud prevention agencies may be required (for the purposes described in this notice) to:
• transfer personal data from the UK to the EU, the European Economic Area (EEA) or elsewhere; and
• receive personal data from outside the UK (including from the EU or EEA) into the UK.
If we, or fraud prevention agencies, allow your personal data to be transferred outside of the UK, this may be to a country where your information will be protected to UK standards. Otherwise, fraud prevention agencies will make sure your personal data continues to be protected by having appropriate safeguards in place. If necessary we will put appropriate measures in place, such as relevant clauses in contracts, to make sure that personal data is sent and received in line with any laws that apply.

If you ask us to share information with authorised third parties who provide payment-initiation or account-information services, we will follow the request (whether made by you or someone with authority to deal with the account on your behalf) to share the relevant information.
(By ‘authorised third parties’ we mean companies that are authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority or another European regulator to provide the relevant service. In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority’s register (available at https://register.fca.org.uk/) will tell you whether a company is authorised.
We don’t have control over how those third parties use your information. Before you make your request, we recommend that you (or the person acting on your behalf) consider data-protection practices of that third party by reading their privacy policies or contacting them.",,,,1,,,,
barclays_c,Keeping your information,"We will keep your personal data for as long as you are our customer. Once our relationship with you has ended (for example, after your account has closed or following a transaction such as a payment, your application for a product is refused, or you decide not to go ahead with an application), we will only keep your personal data for a period of time that is appropriate for the type of personal data, and what we hold it for.
We will only keep information that allows us to:
• maintain business records for analysis or audit purposes
• keep to relevant laws (for example, laws relating to preventing, detecting and investigating money laundering and funding terrorism)
• defend or take legal action
• keep records of anyone who does not want to receive marketing from us
• deal with any future complaints about the services we have provided
• help with monitoring fraud; or
• assess the effectiveness of marketing we may have sent you.
The period we keep information for is often linked to the amount of time available to bring a legal claim, which in many cases is six or seven years after your account closes or following a transaction such as a payment. We will keep your personal data after this time if we have to do so to keep to the law, if there are existing claims or complaints that will reasonably require us to keep your information, or for regulatory or technical reasons. If we do need to keep your information for a longer period, we will continue to protect that information.",,,,1,,,,

• ask us to correct personal data we hold
• restrict how we use your personal data
• ask us to delete personal data; and
• object to particular ways we are using your personal data.
Your ability to exercise these rights will depend on a number of factors, and in some instances we will not be able to agree to your request (for example, if we have a legitimate reason for not doing so or the right doesn’t apply to the particular information we hold about you).

barclays_c,Automated processing,"The way we analyse personal data relating to our services may involve profiling. This means that we may process your personal data (including sensitive personal data) using software that can evaluate your personal circumstances and other factors to predict risks or outcomes. We may also use profiling, or other automated methods, to make decisions about you that relate to the following.
• Credit and affordability checks to see whether your application will be accepted
• Credit limits
• Anti-money laundering and sanctions checks
• Identity and address checks
• Monitoring your account for fraud and other financial crime, either to prevent you committing fraud, or to prevent you becoming a victim of fraud
• Screening people who may be classed as ‘politically exposed’ (for example, if you are a government minister)
• Assessments required by our regulators and appropriate authorities to make sure we meet our regulatory obligations (for example, making decisions about those at risk of becoming financially vulnerable)
• Deciding whether an account is dormant (that is, no longer used) and, if so, closing it
• Assessing insurance premium levels for customers.
This is known as ‘automated decision-making’ and is only allowed when we have a legal reason for this type of decision- making. We may make automated decisions about you in the following circumstances:
• If automated decisions are necessary for us to enter into a contract. For example, we may decide not to offer our services to you, or we may decide on the types of services that are suitable for you, or how much to charge you for our products, based on your credit history and other financial information we have collected about you
• If automated decisions are required or authorised by law (for example, to prevent fraud)
• If it is a reasonable way of keeping to government regulation or guidance, such as our obligation to treat customers fairly.

• To choose personalised offers, discounts or recommendations to send you, based on various factors such as your credit history and how you use the accounts and products you hold with us.

• To categorise your spending and present this information to you in a variety of ways, to help you to manage your finances
• To help us work out our overall credit risk as a bank, but in a way that does not affect you
• To help us work out prices for products, but in a way that has a minimal effect on you.
We may also carry out automated anti-money laundering and sanctions checks. This means that we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if the automated processing finds that your behaviour is consistent with money laundering or known fraudulent behaviour, is inconsistent with your previous interactions with us, or you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity.
If we, or a fraud prevention agency, decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk:
• we may refuse to provide the services you have asked for or we may stop providing existing services to you; and
• a record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be kept by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services to you or employ you.

The Advance Limit forms part of the Credit Limit and is the most you are allowed to owe for Advances. We will give you notice of these limits and may change them. Advances are when you use your credit card account for: Withdrawing cash
Payments to a UK bank or building society current account (Money Transfers). Please note that Money Transfers may incur a different rate of interest from the Advances rate. Please see your interest rates tabled at section 4 for details of the rates which apply to this Agreement.
Purchasing and topping up electronic money or payment cards (including purchases or top-ups of electronic money that are immediately used to fund another transaction), vouchers (including electronic vouchers), travellers’ cheques, foreign currency (for example purchasing currency through Travelex)
Repaying borrowing to another lender (excluding Balance Transfers)
Transferring funds
Payments to merchants we identify as being in the business of gambling, even if not for a bet (Gambling Transactions). Gambling Transactions are any transactions with someone operating gambling facilities, such as casinos, bookmakers or online gambling sites. Please note that this will also include non-gambling transactions, such as buying food or drink in a casino. You will be charged a Cash Fee for all Advances. Please see the Charges Tariff for details of the Cash Fee.
A transaction where you buy goods or services using your card or card number is a Purchase unless we have described it as an Advance.
Balance Transfers are when we pay your debt to another financial institution and charge it to your account. Balance Transfers are not treated as Advances and cannot be made to pay a debt you owe us or any other member of NatWest Group. Subject to available credit, you may carry out Balance Transfers up to 95% of your Credit Limit. Each Balance Transfer must be for at least £100.
You can request an increase in your Credit Limit. Before agreeing an increase, we will assess your ability to pay. After notice of a Credit Limit increase you can tell us you wish to keep your existing limit or request the increase as soon as possible. At any time you can request a reduction in your Credit Limit and opt out of future Credit Limit increases.

You can pay the whole or part of your balance at any time using the payment methods described on your statement.
When we ask, you must immediately pay us any amount you owe over your Credit Limit.
We encourage you to pay more than the minimum amount each month, to clear your balance more quickly and pay less interest. If you’re finding it difficult to make payments please tell us so that we can try to help.

natwest_c,1 Cards,"(a) We will issue a card and PIN (personal identification number) to you and open an account. You may request the issue of cards and PIN(s) to others but we may decide not to issue them or to limit the number issued.
(b) You (and any additional cardholder) must:
• sign the card when received and follow any activation procedures;
• keep each card secure and not allow any other person to use it;
• keep all your Security Details (including passwords, log-in details for telephone, mobile or online banking and PINs) safe and take all reasonable precautions to prevent them becoming known to any person who is not authorised to access your account and prevent their fraudulent use (including not recording them in a way that could allow another person to access them);
• be aware that if you give your online Security Details to a third party provider, we’re not responsible for what they do with your details or account information; and
• if you’re logged on to online or mobile banking, not leave the device (for example, the mobile phone or computer) you’re using unattended and make sure that any information stored or displayed on your device is kept secure.
We’ll never ask you to disclose your full Security Details to us or to any other person or organisation. Even if the person requesting your Security Details is using our name and logo and appears to be genuine, you must not share your Security Details with them.
Some third party providers might ask you for your online Security Details to provide their service to you. If you decide to give them this information, this means that they’ll be able to see and do anything you can on your account.
(c) You (and any additional cardholder) must not:
• exceed your Credit Limit or Advance Limit;
• use a card after it has expired or been cancelled;
• use a card for illegal purposes.
(d) We may reissue a card or issue a different card type from the one you applied for and your account number may change.",,,,1,,,,
natwest_c,2 Card transactions,"(a) You (and any additional cardholder) may carry out transactions with the card or card number, after we have opened the account, by following any procedures required and you must pay all amounts charged to the account.
(b) Any transaction in a foreign currency will be converted to sterling at the Payment Scheme Exchange Rate (the rate provided by Visa, Mastercard or any other payment scheme), at the date of application to the account. For information on exchange rates you can call the number at the end of these General Conditions or visit the website of the payment scheme shown on your card (for example, Visa or Mastercard).
(c) Provided you do not exceed the Credit Limitor Advance Limit, you (or any additional cardholder) can use a card to withdraw cash from cash machines up to your daily cash withdrawal limit. This limit applies to withdrawals inside and outside the UK and we may change it from time to time. You will be charged the Cash Fee and interest at the Advances rate for these withdrawals.

                (d) You and any additional cardholder you have authorised may make Money Transfers and Balance Transfers. If we receive a Balance Transfer or Money Transfer instruction:
• before 6pm on a business day, it will reach the other bank or lender on the next business day;
• on a non-business day (i.e. the weekend or a bank holiday) or after 6pm on a business day, we will treat it as received on the next business day and it will reach the other bank or lender on the business day after that.
Please make sure that you provide us with correct details for the other account, including the credit card number for a Balance Transfer and the account number and sort code for a Money Transfer.
If incorrect details are provided for a Money Transfer or Balance Transfer it may not be completed or payment may go to the wrong account. We will make reasonable efforts to recover the payment and may charge you our reasonable costs. If we are unable to recover the payment, you can ask us to send you available information on it so that you can attempt recovery.
Where correct details are provided, but there is an error in making the Money Transfer or Balance Transfer:
• you must tell us about this without undue delay and in any event no later than 13 months after the date on which the transaction was debited to your account by calling the number at the end of these General Conditions;
• you can ask us to investigate what has happened to the payment;
• if the error is our fault, we will refund the amount of the payment, plus any extra interest and charges that you incur on your accounts as a result; and
• if the payment arrives late, you can ask us to request that the other bank or lender treats it as made on time (this may require them to refund interest and charges incurred on the account receiving the payment).
(e) A transaction is authorised where you (or an additional cardholder):
• follow the procedures required by the merchant, which may include:
– entering the PIN or providing any other security code;
– signing a sales voucher;
– providing any details requested;
– using a card reader; or
– using a contactless payment unit.
• use a card and PIN to obtain an Advance at a machine or bank counter;
• provide the card details to us, and if required one or more of the following: the payee name, address and date of birth, when you request a Balance Transfer, Advance, or Money Transfer;
• orally or in writing consent to the transaction after it has taken place; or
• by any other means we tell you are available – this may include asking you to take extra steps (for example, entering a one-time passcode that we send you) to authorise transactions, including when you pay a merchant.
Authorisation can cover single transactions or Recurring Transactions, or a future transaction of a certain or uncertain amount.
Recurring Transactions are regular payments (including for an indefinite period) that you (or an additional cardholder) authorise a third party to collect from your account. Recurring Transactions are not covered by the Direct Debit Guarantee.
(f) We may refuse a transaction if:
• we suspect the card has been lost or stolen;
• processing the transaction would break the terms of this Agreement;
• you have broken the terms of this Agreement in a serious way;

• you would go over your Credit Limit or Advance Limit (taking account of any amounts yet to be applied);
• we believe your account is being used for illegal purposes (such as money laundering);
• we believe there has been fraud on your account or it is at risk of someone using it to make a fraudulent or unauthorised transaction;
• we reasonably believe that you (or an additional cardholder) did not authorise the instruction;
• we must do so to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those designed to stop fraud on your account;
• as a result of a change in the way you operate your account or in your financial circumstances, we reasonably believe that you may have difficulty in meeting your commitments;
• you use a service that we offer to restrict transactions of that type or to suspend your card;
• the merchant involved falls within a category that we have determined poses a high risk of not providing the goods or services you are expecting, or we determine that the transaction falls within a category that poses a high risk of financial loss to our customers;
• the merchant does not provide us with the information we require to verify the transaction (for example the encrypted data we use to verify the use of Chip & Pin; this often occurs in certain foreign jurisdictions).
If we refuse a transaction, we will, if possible, give you the reason for the refusal and you may be able to correct any information which led to it. You can obtain this information about the refusal by calling the number provided at the end of these General Conditions. We may also tell you orally or in writing.
Generally, once authorised, a transaction cannot be stopped, although we may be able to stop it if we receive satisfactory evidence that it has been cancelled. You may cancel Recurring Transactions either by telephoning us on 0370 333 9091 or by contacting the merchant, in each case by the end of the business day before the next transaction is due to be made. If you request us to cancel Recurring Transactions, we advise that you should also give notice of the cancellation to the merchant because such cancellation does not affect any continuing obligation you may have to the merchant.
Ifyouuseyourcardtopayamerchant,wewillonlymakethepaymentwhenwereceivethe request from the merchant’s bank. This means there may be a delay between using your card to make a payment and the transaction appearing on your account. The transaction will show on your account within one business day of us receiving the request for it.
If you have received unsatisfactory goods or services paid for with your card, costing over £100 but not more than £30,000, or if a merchant has otherwise broken their agreement with you or misrepresented these goods or services, you may have a claim against us as well as the merchant under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
We do not guarantee that a card or card details will be accepted. We are not liable if any merchant or machine fails to let you (or an additional cardholder) pay or withdraw cash or we cannot provide any part of our service for a reason beyond our control.
You may sometimes use your card to authorise a transaction where the amount to be paid is not known, for example when you check into a hotel or hire a car. If this happens you should be asked to confirm the exact amount that will be blocked on your account. If you have agreed that an exact amount can be blocked, we will reduce your available credit and that amount will not be available for you to use. Once we become aware of the amount of the transaction, we will release the blocked funds and restore your available credit. Please note that if you make the payment using a different card or payment method (for example cash), we will not know that payment has been made and it may take us longer to restore your available credit, but we will usually release the blocked funds within 7 days.

                (l) If you do not know the final payment amount when you authorise a transaction, we will refund you, provided:
• the amount of the payment exceeded what you could reasonably have expected to pay (excluding increases resulting from exchange rate fluctuations);
• the payment was made in the European Economic Area; and
• you ask for a refund within 8 weeks of the date the payment left your account.
You won’t be refunded if you gave your consent to the payment directly to us and, at least 4 weeks in advance:
• we or the merchant provided you with information about the payment; or
• information about the payment was made available to you (for example, at any branch or through online banking).
We may ask you for additional information to decide whether you should be refunded. We’ll refund you, or explain why we’re refusing the refund, within 10 business days of your request for a refund or (if we’ve asked you for additional information) within 10 business days of us receiving that information.",,,transaction,0,,,,

(b) You cannot choose how a payment is applied to your account. We apply any payments you make to your account in the following order:
• to pay your contractual Minimum Payment under section 2 of this Agreement;
• to pay any Instalment Plan fees;
• to pay any monthly Instalment Plan repayments (if you have more than one plan we’ll first pay off the one which ends soonest);
• to reduce sums shown on your most recent monthly statement (excluding Instalment Plans), according to their interest rates, with the highest rate paid first;
• to reduce the remainder of the outstanding balance(s) on any Instalment Plan(s) on the account; and
• finally, if any payment exceeds your most recent monthly statement balance, the excess will then be applied to reduce sums charged to your account but not yet shown on any monthly statement. This is also done according to their interest rates, with the highest interest rate paid first.
(c) If parts of any of the balances referred to in (b) have the same:
• interest rate, sums on which interest is charged on interest will reduce first;
• special offer interest rate, they will be reduced according to their special offer expiry dates, with the earlier paid first.

natwest_c,7 Lost or stolen cards,"(a) If a card is lost or stolen, or you suspect it is lost or stolen, or that some one who is not authorised to access your account knows its details, or your Security Details, or that a card, its details or its Security Details were used without your agreement, you must tell us immediately. The address and telephone numbers are at the end of these General Conditions, and you can also call us from a branch.
(b) If a card is misused before you report its loss or theft, or that someone else knows the Security Details, you will only have to pay up to £35 for any misuse.
But if the card is misused by someone who has it with your permission, you will have to pay for all transactions. Once you have given notice of loss, theft or possible misuse, we will cancel the card and you will not be liable for any further transactions. If you then find the card you must not use it. To prevent fraud, cut it in half through the signature box, magnetic strip and chip.
(c) We may give any appropriate third party information:
• in connection with the use, loss, or theft of the card, and/or the Security Details; or
• in order to meet our obligations as a member of the relevant payment scheme.
(d) If we know or suspect that your card or its details, or Security Details have been used without your agreement, we will contact you using the most recent details we hold for you. We may do so using any of the means of communication set out at General Condition 10. Remember, we’ll never ask you to disclose your full Security Details to us or to any other person or organisation.",,,,1,,,,

• we notify you that we are closing your card;
• we believe your account is being used for illegal purposes (such as money laundering);
• we believe there has been fraud on your account or it is at risk of someone using it to make a fraudulent or unauthorised transaction;
• there is a change in how you operate your account or your financial circumstances giving us reasonable grounds to believe you may have difficulty meeting your commitments; or
• you pay off more interest, fees and charges than other amounts over two, consecutive 18-month periods and then either refuse to increase your monthly payments as requested or are unable to do so (including where you start, but cannot continue, to pay the higher amounts),
we may suspend, restrict or withdraw the use of any card or the account and/or reduce the Credit Limit and Advance Limit at any time. Any merchant or machine may then retain any card. You will be told before this action is taken, or as soon as possible afterwards. You may request restoration of a card and/or the account by calling the number at the end of these General Conditions.
(b) As part of our fraud prevention policy, we may:
• restrict overpayments to your account that are in excess of your balance;
• suspend or restrict the ability to carry out Balance Transfers and/or Money Transfers on our credit cards – we will only do so where we reasonably consider that the level of fraud on Balance Transfers and/or Money Transfers is so high that there is a real risk of any such transaction being fraudulent.
(c) This Agreement has no minimum duration but you may end it by giving notice and paying all sums owed and any interest, fees and charges to the date of payment. We will refund a proportionate part of any annual fee. To prevent fraud, cut all cards in half through the signature box, magnetic strip and chip.

If we tell you you’re eligible to move a transaction or eligible Balance Transfer to an Instalment Plan, you’ll have a set amount of time to tell us you want to do this.

Due to how we apply payments, if you only partly pay one Instalment Plan repayment then the Instalment Plan fee (or a proportion of it) may also go back into your main balance. You will see any missed or partly made Instalment Plan repayments in the app. We will not charge interest on the Instalment Plan fee.
If you miss or partly pay two Instalment Plan repayments, the full Instalment Plan balance will go back into the main part of your credit card balance from your next monthly statement date and interest will be charged at your normal Purchases or Balance Transfers rate, as applicable.

The heading ""1.1 Your Top-Up card"" does not explicitly mention the topic of the cash card, which is introduced in the body text.

santander_a,2. Monthly funding reqs,You are not required to pay money into your accounts with a set amount each month.,0,0,monthly,0,1,0,"Answer: No

Justification: The header ""Monthly funding reqs"" suggests that the body text should discuss requirements or obligations related to monthly funding, such as minimum deposits or payments.

The heading ""3. Interest rates"" implies that the following section will discuss interest rates, but the body text ""We do not pay interest on these accounts."" contradicts this expectation.

The heading ""4. Overdraft"" does not explicitly match the content of the body text, which discusses the unavailability of overdraft services on certain accounts and the refusal of payments due to lack of funds. The term ""overdraft"" is used in the context of an Unarranged Overdraft, but it's not directly related to the traditional concept of an overdraft service.",1

Justification: The header ""Paying money in"" suggests that the body text should discuss ways to deposit or add funds into an account.

The heading ""Paying money out"" does not match the body text, which primarily discusses receiving payments (salary) and paying in cash and cheques, rather than paying money out. The phrase ""paying money out"" implies outgoing transactions, whereas the body text focuses on incoming transactions and depositing funds.",1
santander_a,3.3 Cash withdrawals,"You can withdraw cash at Santander cash machines or Santander branches using your Top-up card.

For example a hotel may do this to cover the cost of the stay including any bar expenses etc. The authorisation is only removed when you pay the final bill.",0,0,"transaction, card",0,0,1,"Answer: Yes

Justification: The header asks about ""transactions not allowed"" with the Top-Up card, and the body text lists specific types of transactions that are not permitted, such as recurring and instalment transactions, automated/pay at pump petrol stations, car hire, parking or vending machines, setting up Direct Debits, standing orders, or making transfers from the Top-Up card.

Justification: The header ""Going paper-free"" suggests that the following text would discuss the benefits or process of switching to digital documents, but instead, the body text explains how customers receive physical documents and statements, including an option to switch to paper-free.

santander_f,General limit of protection,"If a covered deposit is unavailable because a bank, building society or credit union is unable to meet its financial obligations, depositors are repaid by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme. This repayment covers at maximum £85,000 per bank, building society or credit union. This means that all eligible deposits at the same bank, building society or credit union are added up in order to determine the coverage level. If, for instance a depositor holds a savings account with £80,000 and a current account with £20,000, he or she will only be repaid £85,000.
This method will also be applied if a bank, building society or credit union operates under different trading names. Santander UK plc also trades under cahoot, Santander Corporate & Commercial, and Santander Corporate & Investment Banking trading names.
In some cases eligible deposits which are categorised as ‘temporary high balances’ are protected above £85,000 for six months after the amount has been credited or from the moment when such eligible deposits become legally transferable. These are eligible deposits connected with certain events including:
(a) certain transactions relating to the depositor’s current or prospective only or main residence or dwelling;
(b) a death, or the depositor’s marriage or civil partnership, divorce, retirement, dismissal, redundancy or invalidity;
