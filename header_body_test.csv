santander_l,Personal Loan,
santander_l,Pre-Contractual explanation,
santander_l,What is a 'Personal Loan?',"A personal loan from Santander is a loan for a fixed amount, repayable over a fixed period of time with interest charged at a fixed rate. The duration or term of the loan will depend on what is agreed at the time the loan is made but is generally for a short or medium term. The loan is unsecured which means that Santander will not take a charge over your property when you take out the loan."
santander_l,Put Simply,"It's money that you borrow from us. The amount of the money that you borrow, the interest rate and the repayment time period are all fixed. We don't take security for a personal loan."
santander_l,What checks do you need to do for me to get a personal loan with Santander," If you wish to apply for a loan then we will, with your prior consent, conduct a search of your credit history with a credit reference agency. This will leave a record on your credit file. We may decline your application if you provide us with any false information as part of your application, or if there are issues with your credit score when we check your details with a credit reference agency. We will give you details of the agency that we used to inform our decision so you may contact them. For more information, a leaflet called ‘Your application and credit scoring’ is available on request."
santander_l,Put Simply,"To apply for a personal loan you must agree to us conducting a credit check on you. It's very important to provide accurate information in your application - we might decline your application based on the results of your credit check, or if you have provided false information."
santander_l,How much do I have to pay under the agreement,"You will need to make repayments every month which include principal (the original loan amount) and interest over the duration of the loan. The monthly repayments will be for the same amount every month until the loan is fully repaid. Details of the amount you have to pay (both monthly and in total, including all interest) including the frequency and number of repayments, and the duration of the loan, are contained in your credit agreement."
santander_l,Put Simply,"You pay a fixed amount each month (made up of the original loan amount and the interest charged). Your credit agreement will detail how much you pay (in total and each month), and when the payments will be due."
santander_l,What are the consequences if I do not keep up with repayments?,"If you fail to make a repayment on the date it falls due you may be charged interest on any arrears that you incur at the same interest rate as you pay on your loan. As a consequence the total cost of the loan may increase. If you have any current or savings account with Santander UK or any other member of the Santander Group, we may move funds from those accounts to settle any outstanding payments on your loan. If you miss a loan payment we will record the details with a credit reference agency which could damage your credit rating and may make it more difficult for you to obtain credit in the future. Also, failure to make your loan payments when they fall due may result in legal proceedings being taken against you by Santander UK plc, which may result in us taking enforcement action against you in order to recover the monies that are owed. If you don’t make your repayments and incur significant arrears we may decide to sell or transfer your loan to a debt recovery company. That company may commence legal proceedings against you that may result in enforcement action being taken against your property for recovery of the monies owed."
santander_l,Put Simply,"If you miss a repayment, you’ll be charged interest on the missed payment, so you end up paying back more on your loan. In addition, we can deduct the missed payment and interest from your other accounts with us. If you miss multiple repayments, your credit rating can be damaged and you might have personal legal proceedings brought against you. To avoid getting into this situation, please contact us if you are having difficulties in making your repayments."
santander_l,Are there any features of the agreement which may operate in a manner which may adversely affect me?,"Before applying for a Personal Loan you should read all the pre-contractual information and the credit agreement provided to you carefully to ensure that this is the best product for you and that you understand the features of this product. If you breach the terms of the agreement you may be charged default interest which is detailed in your credit agreement. Also, if you don’t make your repayments and incur significant arrears we may decide to sell or transfer your loan to a debt recovery company."
santander_l,Put Simply,We’ve prepared a document for you called ‘Pre-contract Credit Information’ which you should read and consider carefully before taking out a Personal Loan to make sure that it is right for you.
santander_l,Your Right to Cancel (and repay early),"You have 14 days to change your mind from the date that you sign the agreement – this can be either changing the amount of the loan, seeking a different facility, or cancelling the loan altogether. If you exercise the right to withdraw from the agreement you must repay any monies we have advanced to you within 30 days from the date that you notified us of your intention to cancel. If you want to cancel you can do so by contacting us in writing or by telephone. Please refer to the agreement for details and the addresses of who to contact. You are entitled to repay the loan in full any time after the initial period of 14 days. Details of how you may do this and who to contact if you wish to exercise this right – together with details of any charges that may apply – are contained in the agreement."
santander_l,Put Simply,"You can change your mind up to 14 days after you sign. If you do this, you must repay anything you owe. You may repay the loan in full at any time before the final payment is due. Details of how to do this are in your agreement. A personal loan is designed for borrowing a fixed amount of money over the full term of the loan, however it can be repaid early, if you wish. If you’re thinking about doing this you should carefully check your credit contract beforehand, as costs and charges may apply when it is repaid before the end of the full term."

first_direct_l,Terms and Conditions,
first_direct_l,Personal Loan Terms and Conditions,
first_direct_l,How and when will we give you the loan?,"When you have signed and returned the agreement, we will sign it. The agreement will start on that day and will end when you have repaid everything you owe us. 1. We will pay the loan into the current account you gave in your application. This will usually be no more than 5 working days after the start date or the specific date you asked for. If the loan is to repay any other borrowing from us, the amount in your current account will be what is left over (if anything) after we have taken away the amount needed to repay those borrowings. 2. If you repay more than the total amount payable, we will close the account and return the amount you overpaid to another account you hold with us or by sending you a cheque."
first_direct_l,What is the cost of the loan?,"3. We charge a fixed amount of interest which we add to the loan when we open the loan account. The total amount payable by you is the sum of interest and the loan. Although it is added upfront, we work out interest (and the APR) as if the loan amount was reduced by each projected repayment, using the interest rate, the number of monthly repayments and the period of the loan. In other words, your monthly repayments will pay off the sum of interest and the loan amount in different proportions each month. Towards the start of your loan, your monthly payments will pay off more interest, and towards the end of the loan they will pay off more of the loan amount. For these purposes, we assume we provide the loan one month before the first repayment date. "
first_direct_l,How must you repay the loan?,"4. You must make the monthly repayments set out in your agreement. If a repayment date is a non-working day you must make the repayment (or we will collect it) on the next working day. 5. After you have mde your first repayment, you can change the monthly repayment date if you ask us. We will not be able ot change your next repayment date but we will change all subsequent repayment dates. You can only change the date twice in any 12 month period. Changing the repayment date will not affect the amount of interest on the loan."
first_direct_l,What should you do if your details change?,"6. If you change your name, address, telephone number or email address you must tell us in writing or by calling us. We will use the most recent details you have given us to send information and contact you."
first_direct_l,Can you repay the loan early?,"7. You can repay all, or part, of the loan early by giving us notice in writing or by telephone. If you give us notice, we will tell you the amount needed to repay the loan in full within the next 28 days (or on a later date you tell us). 8. If you repay part of the loan early, your monthly repayment will stay the same but you may repay the loan more quickly. If you repay the loan in full, the formula in the regulations we use to work out the reduced amount of interest we can charge, works as if we charged interest at the rate that applies to the loan from the date we gave you the loan to the date which is 28 days after you give us notice, plus an additional month if your loan is repayable over a period of more than 12 months. For example, if the loan is for 36 months and you give us notice on 1 September that you want to repay the loan on 14 September, the amount required to repay the loan will include interest up to 29 October."
first_direct_l,What are our rights if you miss a repayment or we have other concerns?,"9. There may be severe consequences if: (a) you do not make repayments on time; or (b) we find that any information you provided as part of your loan application was materially incorrect or misleading; or (c) you are declared bankrupt or have similar proceedings taken against you; or (d) we reasonably suspect any fraud or other criminal activity in connection with this agreement and/or any other facility or account that you have with us. In any of these cases, we can: demand immediate repayment of the loan; restrict access to credit on other accounts you have with us (such as an overdraft or credit card); bring legal action to recover the loan (which could include asking a court to order that, if a property you own is sold for any reason, some of the sale proceeds are used to repay this loan); and require you to pay our reasonable costs and expenses for taking action to obtain payment, including legal costs; but we will give you advance notice and (unless the problem cannot be fixed) the opportunity to fix the problem before taking any of these steps. 10. If we choose not to enforce our rights under this agreement at any time, we may enforce them at a later date instead."
first_direct_l,Can we use any other funds to repay the loan?,"11. If we hold any money for you on another account (for example if you have money in a current or savings account), we can use it to reduce or repay any sums you fail to pay under this agreement but only after we have checked that you have enough left in your accounts to cover essential living costs. We will give you advance notice and the opportunity to fix the problem first. 12. If you have provided security for any other borrowing from us, it will not apply to the loan."
first_direct_l,Can we transfer our rights under this agreement?,"13. We may transfer our rights and our obligations under this agreement to a third party, including information about you and how you have managed the loan which the third party needs to know."
first_direct_l,What law governs this agreement?,"14. This agreement, and everything that happens in relation to this agreement before it is made, are governed by the laws, and subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts, of England and Wales. We will communicate with you at all times in English."
first_direct_l,Right to withdraw,"You can withdraw from this agreement (without giving any reason) by sending written notice or calling us within 14 days, starting the day after we confirm that we have signed the agreement.

This statement will be in the form of a table setting out: details (including the amounts) of the repayments you still owe, the dates on which each repayment is due, and a breakdown of each repayment showing how much comprises capital, interest and, if applicable, other charges.
