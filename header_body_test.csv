santander_l,Personal Loan,
santander_l,Pre-Contractual explanation,
santander_l,What is a 'Personal Loan?',"A personal loan from Santander is a loan for a fixed amount, repayable over a fixed period of time with interest charged at a fixed rate. The duration or term of the loan will depend on what is agreed at the time the loan is made but is generally for a short or medium term. The loan is unsecured which means that Santander will not take a charge over your property when you take out the loan."
santander_l,Put Simply,"It's money that you borrow from us. The amount of the money that you borrow, the interest rate and the repayment time period are all fixed. We don't take security for a personal loan."
santander_l,What checks do you need to do for me to get a personal loan with Santander," If you wish to apply for a loan then we will, with your prior consent, conduct a search of your credit history with a credit reference agency. This will leave a record on your credit file. We may decline your application if you provide us with any false information as part of your application, or if there are issues with your credit score when we check your details with a credit reference agency. We will give you details of the agency that we used to inform our decision so you may contact them. For more information, a leaflet called ‘Your application and credit scoring’ is available on request."
santander_l,Put Simply,"To apply for a personal loan you must agree to us conducting a credit check on you. It's very important to provide accurate information in your application - we might decline your application based on the results of your credit check, or if you have provided false information."
santander_l,How much do I have to pay under the agreement,"You will need to make repayments every month which include principal (the original loan amount) and interest over the duration of the loan. The monthly repayments will be for the same amount every month until the loan is fully repaid. Details of the amount you have to pay (both monthly and in total, including all interest) including the frequency and number of repayments, and the duration of the loan, are contained in your credit agreement."
santander_l,Put Simply,"You pay a fixed amount each month (made up of the original loan amount and the interest charged). Your credit agreement will detail how much you pay (in total and each month), and when the payments will be due."
santander_l,What are the consequences if I do not keep up with repayments?,"If you fail to make a repayment on the date it falls due you may be charged interest on any arrears that you incur at the same interest rate as you pay on your loan. As a consequence the total cost of the loan may increase. If you have any current or savings account with Santander UK or any other member of the Santander Group, we may move funds from those accounts to settle any outstanding payments on your loan. If you miss a loan payment we will record the details with a credit reference agency which could damage your credit rating and may make it more difficult for you to obtain credit in the future. Also, failure to make your loan payments when they fall due may result in legal proceedings being taken against you by Santander UK plc, which may result in us taking enforcement action against you in order to recover the monies that are owed. If you don’t make your repayments and incur significant arrears we may decide to sell or transfer your loan to a debt recovery company. That company may commence legal proceedings against you that may result in enforcement action being taken against your property for recovery of the monies owed."
santander_l,Put Simply,"If you miss a repayment, you’ll be charged interest on the missed payment, so you end up paying back more on your loan. In addition, we can deduct the missed payment and interest from your other accounts with us. If you miss multiple repayments, your credit rating can be damaged and you might have personal legal proceedings brought against you. To avoid getting into this situation, please contact us if you are having difficulties in making your repayments."
santander_l,Are there any features of the agreement which may operate in a manner which may adversely affect me?,"Before applying for a Personal Loan you should read all the pre-contractual information and the credit agreement provided to you carefully to ensure that this is the best product for you and that you understand the features of this product. If you breach the terms of the agreement you may be charged default interest which is detailed in your credit agreement. Also, if you don’t make your repayments and incur significant arrears we may decide to sell or transfer your loan to a debt recovery company."
santander_l,Put Simply,We’ve prepared a document for you called ‘Pre-contract Credit Information’ which you should read and consider carefully before taking out a Personal Loan to make sure that it is right for you.
santander_l,Your Right to Cancel (and repay early),"You have 14 days to change your mind from the date that you sign the agreement – this can be either changing the amount of the loan, seeking a different facility, or cancelling the loan altogether. If you exercise the right to withdraw from the agreement you must repay any monies we have advanced to you within 30 days from the date that you notified us of your intention to cancel. If you want to cancel you can do so by contacting us in writing or by telephone. Please refer to the agreement for details and the addresses of who to contact. You are entitled to repay the loan in full any time after the initial period of 14 days. Details of how you may do this and who to contact if you wish to exercise this right – together with details of any charges that may apply – are contained in the agreement."
santander_l,Put Simply,"You can change your mind up to 14 days after you sign. If you do this, you must repay anything you owe. You may repay the loan in full at any time before the final payment is due. Details of how to do this are in your agreement. A personal loan is designed for borrowing a fixed amount of money over the full term of the loan, however it can be repaid early, if you wish. If you’re thinking about doing this you should carefully check your credit contract beforehand, as costs and charges may apply when it is repaid before the end of the full term."
