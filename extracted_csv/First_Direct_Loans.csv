para,"What should you do if your details change? When you have signed and returned the agreement, we will sign it. The agreement will start on that day and will end when you have repaid everything you owe us. 1. We will pay the loan into the current account you gave in your application. This will usually be no more than 5 working days after the start date or the specific date you asked for. If the loan is to repay any other borrowing from us, the amount in your current account will be what is left over (if anything) after we have taken away the amount needed to repay those borrowings. 6. If you change your name, address, telephone number or email address you must tell us in writing or by calling us. We will use the most recent details you have given us to send information and contact you.",1
para,Can you repay the loan early?,1
list_item,"7. You can repay all, or part, of the loan early by giving us notice in writing or by telephone. If you give us notice, we will tell you the amount needed to repay the loan in full within the next 28 days (or on a later date you tell us).",1
list_item,"2. If you repay more than the total amount payable, we will close the account and return the amount you overpaid to another account you hold with us or by sending you a cheque.",2
para,What is the cost of the loan?,2
list_item,"3. We charge a fixed amount of interest which we add to the loan when we open the loan account. The total amount payable by you is the sum of interest and the loan. Although it is added upfront, we work out interest (and the APR) as if the loan amount was reduced by each projected repayment, using the interest rate, the number of monthly repayments and the period of the loan. In other words, your monthly repayments will pay off the sum of interest and the loan amount in different proportions each month. Towards the start of your loan, your monthly payments will pay off more interest, and towards the end of the loan they will pay off more of the loan amount. For these purposes, we assume we provide the loan one month before the first repayment date. 8. If you repay part of the loan early, your monthly repayment will stay the same but you may repay the loan more quickly. If you repay the loan in full, the formula in the regulations we use to work out the reduced amount of interest we can charge, works as if we charged interest at the rate that applies to the loan from the date we gave you the loan to the date which is 28 days after you give us notice, plus an additional month if your loan is repayable over a period of more than 12 months. For example, if the loan is for 36 months and you give us notice on 1 September that you want to repay the loan on 14 September, the amount required to repay the loan will include interest up to 29 October.",2
