barclays,What happens if someone dies,"9.1 If you die, your Customer Agreement will continue until either we or your personal representative end it. We'll ask for evidence confirming your death and the legal appointment of your personal representative. 9.2 Sometimes a personal representative might want to give us an instruction before we have evidence that they have been legally appointed. If this happens, we'll decide whether we should act on their instruction. We might ask for evidence that they are the right person to take instructions from, and that your estate is not insolvent (for example, that all your creditors have been paid, or will be paid out of your estate). We might also check with your beneficiaries that they don't object to us acting on your personal representative's instructions. 9.3 We'll accept an instruction from a personal representative to pay inheritance tax using money in your account, even if we don't have evidence that they have been legally appointed. 9.4 Some estates are small enough that the personal representative doesn't have to be appointed legally to act for the estate. If this is the case, we can decide to pay the balance in your account(s) on the instructions of your personal representative. We'll ask them to sign an agreement that they'll reimburse us if we incur any loss as a result of letting them take the money out of your account(s). 9.5 Unless the law prevents us, we'll close all your accounts that are still open within two years of the date of your death. We can claim against your estate or your personal representative for our reasonable costs in closing your account(s).",1.0,die,,0

hsbc,How and when will we give you the loan?,"When you have signed and returned the agreement, we will sign it. The agreement will start on that day and will end when you have repaid everything you owe us. 1. We will pay the loan into the current account you gave in your application. This will usually be no more than five working days after the start date or the specific date you asked for. If the loan is to repay any other borrowing from us, the amount in your current account will be what is left over (if anything) after we have taken away the amount needed to repay those borrowings. 2. If you repay more than the total amount payable, we will close the account and return the amount you overpaid to another account you hold with us or by sending you a cheque.",0.0,,give,1
hsbc,What is the cost of the loan?,"3. We charge a fixed amount of interest which we add to the loan when we open the loan account. The total amount payable by you is the sum of interest and the loan. Although it is added upfront, we work out interest (and the APR) as if the loan amount was reduced by each projected repayment, using the interest rate, the number of monthly repayments and the period of the loan. For these purposes, we assume we provide the loan one month (or, if you have an initial payment holiday, three months) before the first repayment date.",1.0,cost,cost,1
hsbc,How must you repay the loan?,"4. You must make the monthly repayments set out in your agreement. If a repayment date is a non-working day you must make the repayment (or we will collect it) on the next working day. 5. After you have made your first repayment, you can change the monthly repayment date if you ask us. We will not be able to change your next repayment date but we will change all subsequent repayment dates. You can only change the date twice in any 12 month period. Changing the repayment date will not affect the amount of interest on the loan.",1.0,repay,repay,1
hsbc,What should you do if your details change?,"6. If you change your name, address, telephone number or email address you must tell us in writing or by calling us. We will use the most recent details you have given us to send information and contact you.",1.0,details,change,1
hsbc,Can you repay the loan early?,"7. You can repay all, or part, of the loan early by giving us notice in writing or by telephone. If you give us notice, we will tell you the amount needed to repay the loan in full within the next 28 days (or on a later date you tell us). 8. If you repay part of the loan early, your monthly repayment will stay the same but you may repay the loan more quickly. If you repay the loan in full, the formula in the regulations we use to work out the reduced amount of interest we can charge, works as if we charged interest at the rate that applies to the loan from the date we gave you the loan to the date which is 28 days after you give us notice, plus an additional month if your loan is repayable over a period of more than 12 months. For example, if the loan is for 36 months and you give us notice on 1 September that you want to repay the loan on 14 September, the amount required to repay the loan will include interest up to 29 October.",1.0,repay,"repay, early",1
hsbc,What are our rights if you miss a repayment or we have other concerns?,"9. There may be severe consequences if: (a) you do not make repayments on time; or (b) we find that any information you provided as part of your loan application was materially incorrect or misleading; or (c) you are declared bankrupt or have similar proceedings taken against you; or (d) we reasonably suspect any fraud or other criminal activity in connection with this agreement and/or any other facility or account that you have with us. In any of these cases, we can: * demand immediate repayment of the loan; * disclose information about you and the conduct of your loan to licensed credit reference agencies (which may make it more difficult for you to borrow in future); * restrict access to credit on other accounts you have with us (such as an overdraft or credit card); * bring legal action to recover the loan (which could include asking a court to order that, if a property you own is sold for any reason, some of the sale proceeds are used to repay this loan); and * require you to pay our reasonable costs and expenses for taking action to obtain payment, including legal costs; but we will give you advance notice and (unless the problem cannot be fixed) the opportunity to fix the problem before taking any of these steps. 10. If we choose not to enforce our rights under this agreement at any time, we may enforce them at a later date instead.",1.0,"rights, repay",repayment,1
hsbc,Can we use any other funds to repay the loan?,"11. If we hold any money for you on another account (for example if you have money in a current or savings account), we can use it to reduce or repay any sums you fail to pay under this agreement but only after we have checked that you have enough left in your accounts to cover essential living costs. We will give you advance notice and the opportunity to fix the problem first. 12. If you have provided security for any other borrowing from us, it will not apply to the loan.",1.0,repay,repay,1
hsbc,Can we transfer our rights under this agreement?,"13. We may transfer our rights and our obligations under this agreement to a third party, including information about you and how you have managed the loan which the third party needs to know.",1.0,"rights, transfer",,0

Purchases do not include balance transfers, cash advances, travellersÃ cheques, foreign currency, and money orders, interest, unauthorised or fraudulent transactions, account charges of any kind (if applicable), or advances used for lottery or gambling payments.
4 Cashback will not be paid on Purchases that you subsequently cancel or return for a refund.",1.0,eligible,eligible,1
santander_c,How we pay cashback,"5 Cashback will be earned at a rate of 0.5% on the eligible Purchases.
6 The cashback award is supplied by Santander UK plc and does not impact on any other offers supplied by the retailer.
7 We will pay you any cashback earned on your Purchases by crediting
your All in One Credit Card account every month. We will add up the
total eligible Purchases on your statement date. You will earn 0.5% on the total amount spent in that month. The cashback earned each month will be credited to your next monthly All in One Credit Card statement. For example, if you use your All in One Credit Card to make a Purchase in February, the cashback earned for that transaction will be credited to your All in One Credit Card account in March.
8 Because cashback is paid on each statement date, if you close your account before a statement date, you will lose any cashback that has been earned but not yet added to your account.
9 Any Purchases refunded to your All in One Credit Card will be deducted from the total of your Purchases for the month in which the refund is made.
10 If the amount of the refunded Purchases exceeds the amount of Purchases in a month, this may generate a negative cashback amount. If that happens, we will not debit that amount from your account.
11 Cashback payments credited to your All in One Credit Card will not count towards your minimum payment, and you must continue to make your minimum payment in full every month.

To help us make decisions on when to give you credit, we use a system called credit scoring to assess your application. To work out your credit score, we look at information you give us when you apply; information from credit reference agencies that will show us whether youÃ¢ÂÂve kept up to date with payments on any credit accounts (that could be any mortgages, loans, credit cards or overdrafts), or if youÃ¢ÂÂve had any court action such as judgments or bankruptcy; your history with us such as maximum level of borrowing; and affordability, by looking at your available net income and existing debts. You have rights in relation to automated decision-making, including a right to appeal if your application is refused. 11.3 We will continue to share information with credit reference agencies about how you manage your account including your account balance, payments into your account, the regularity of payments being made, credit limits and any arrears or default in making payments, while you have a relationship with us. This information will be made available to other organisations (including fraud prevention agencies and other financial institutions) so that they can take decisions about you, your associates and members of your household. 11.4 If false or inaccurate information is provided and/or fraud is identified or suspected, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies and other organisations may access and use this information. 11.5 If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we and others may refuse to provide the services and financing you have requested, to employ you, or we may stop providing existing services to you. 11.6 A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. Fraud prevention agencies can hold your information for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to six years. 11.7 If you would like a copy of your information held by the credit reference and fraud prevention agencies we use, or if you want further details of how your information will be used by these agencies, please visit their websites or contact them using the details below.
